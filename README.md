to better understand the way mass communication influences financial

## Our first tool, Insider Momentum
Form 4's are filed with the SEC whenever a company insider makes a trade. Those companies disclose
everything from the share price their shares were traded at to their final account values. These
have proven to be relevant indicators of future performance (see [[1](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/121002.asp)])
